# Commercial Licensing

If you use this repository commercially and your organization’s gross revenue exceeds 250,000 USD (trailing 12 months), you must obtain a paid commercial license.

What’s covered
- Code (commands, scripts) is licensed by default under PolyForm Small Business 1.0.0, which restricts use by larger organizations.
- Documentation and agent content is licensed by default under CC BY‑NC‑SA 4.0, which forbids commercial use.

Commercial license grants
- Permission to use, modify, and deploy the code and content for commercial purposes above the small‑business cap
- Rights to create and use derivative works internally
- Optional redistribution rights for compiled/internal artifacts (case‑by‑case)

How to obtain a license
- Send a GitHub message to @ubehera with:
  - Organization name, website, and point of contact
  - Estimated annual revenue and intended use
  - Number of users/seats or teams (if applicable)

We will reply with pricing and terms tailored to your use. Upon signature and payment, we will provide a written commercial license granting the above rights.

Notes
- This file is an overview and does not itself grant rights. The authoritative terms are the signed commercial license agreement.
- For small businesses (≤ 250k USD TTM revenue) and noncommercial use, the default licenses apply and no paid license is needed.
