## Installation & Usage

### Quick Install
```bash
# Install all agents for current user
cp -r ubehera/agents/*/*.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Or install specific tier
cp ubehera/agents/01-foundation/*.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Restart Claude Code
clauseapp --restart
```

### Verify Installation
```bash
# Check installed agents
ls ~/.claude/agents/ | grep -E "(code-reviewer|error-diagnostician|test-engineer)"

# Run quality scoring
python ubehera/scripts/quality-scorer.py
```

## Usage Examples

### Complex Task Orchestration
```
"Help me design and implement a secure payment system"
→ agent-coordinator orchestrates:
   → system-design-specialist (architecture)
   → security-architect (threat modeling)
   → api-platform-engineer (API design)
   → test-engineer (test strategy)
```

### Direct Agent Invocation
```
"Review this pull request for security issues"
→ code-reviewer + security-architect collaboration

"Debug this production error"
→ error-diagnostician direct invocation

"Create comprehensive tests for this module"
→ test-engineer direct invocation
```
