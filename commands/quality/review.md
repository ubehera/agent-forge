# Code Review Orchestration

Execute comprehensive code review for: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Review Scope

### Scope Detection
Determine what to review:
- **No arguments**: Review recent changes (git diff)
- **File/directory path**: Review specific code
- **PR number**: Review pull request changes
- **Feature name**: Review related components

### Review Level
- **standard** (default): Code quality, best practices, bugs
- **strict**: Includes performance, accessibility, documentation
- **security**: Focus on security vulnerabilities and compliance

## Review Process

### Phase 1: Static Analysis
Delegate to code-reviewer via Task for:
- Code quality assessment
- Best practices validation
- Bug detection
- Complexity analysis
- Documentation coverage

### Phase 2: Domain Review
Based on code type, invoke specialists:
- **Frontend**: frontend-expert
- **Backend**: backend-architect
- **Database**: database-architect
- **Infrastructure**: aws-cloud-architect
- **Security**: security-architect

### Phase 3: Quality Gates

#### Standard Level (Default)
- ✅ No critical bugs
- ✅ Code follows conventions
- ✅ Tests included
- ✅ Documentation present
- ✅ No obvious performance issues

#### Strict Level
All standard checks plus:
- ✅ >80% test coverage
- ✅ Performance benchmarks pass
- ✅ Accessibility standards met
- ✅ API documentation complete
- ✅ Error handling comprehensive

#### Security Level
All strict checks plus:
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities
- ✅ OWASP Top 10 compliance
- ✅ No secrets/credentials
- ✅ Input validation complete
- ✅ Authentication/authorization correct

## Review Feedback

### Categorized Issues
- 🔴 **Critical**: Bugs, security issues, data loss risks
- 🟡 **Major**: Performance problems, missing tests, bad patterns
- 🔵 **Minor**: Style issues, typos, optimizations
- 💡 **Suggestions**: Improvements, refactoring opportunities

### Actionable Feedback
Each issue includes:
1. **Location**: File path and line number
2. **Issue**: Clear description of problem
3. **Impact**: Why it matters
4. **Solution**: How to fix it
5. **Example**: Code snippet if helpful
