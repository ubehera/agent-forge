## Progressive Quality Assurance

### Quality Gate Stages

#### Stage 1: Development Gates (Fast Feedback)
```yaml
duration: <5_minutes
gates:
  - Unit tests: PASS
  - Code compilation: SUCCESS
  - Basic security scan: CLEAN
  - Code style check: COMPLIANT

agents:
  - code-reviewer (lightweight scan)
  - test-engineer (unit tests only)
```

#### Stage 2: Integration Gates (Comprehensive)
```yaml
duration: <15_minutes
gates:
  - Integration tests: PASS
  - Security vulnerability scan: CLEAN
  - Performance regression check: <5%
  - API contract validation: COMPLIANT

agents:
  - test-engineer (full integration suite)
  - security-architect (comprehensive scan)
  - performance-optimization-specialist (regression analysis)
  - api-platform-engineer (contract validation)
```

#### Stage 3: Production Gates (Exhaustive)
```yaml
duration: <30_minutes
gates:
  - Load testing: TARGETS_MET
  - Security audit: APPROVED
  - Compliance validation: CERTIFIED
  - Disaster recovery: TESTED

agents:
  - All quality agents (comprehensive validation)
  - Specialized compliance and audit agents
```

### Quality Gate Orchestration

#### Parallel Quality Validation
```bash
/quality-gates parallel-validation --max-parallel 4
```

**Parallel Execution**:
- Code quality + Security scan + Performance test + Integration validation
- Independent quality dimensions validated simultaneously
- Consolidated quality report generation
- Fail-fast on critical quality issues

#### Sequential Quality Validation
```bash
/quality-gates sequential-validation --fail-fast
```

**Sequential Execution**:
1. Code quality (fastest feedback)
2. Security validation (critical for progression)
3. Performance validation (resource intensive)
4. Integration validation (comprehensive)
