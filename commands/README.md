# Claude Code Custom Slash Commands

> **Production-ready slash commands for the agent-forge ecosystem**

These custom slash commands orchestrate multi-agent workflows, automate development tasks, and ensure quality standards across the ubehera agent-forge project.

## Installation

Commands are automatically available in this project. To install globally:
```bash
# Copy to user commands directory (preserves subdirectories)
cp -r commands/* ~/.claude/commands/

# Or create a symlink for automatic updates
ln -s $(pwd)/commands ~/.claude/commands/ubehera

# Restart Claude Code to load commands
```

## Command Architecture

### Security & Design Principles
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal tool permissions with specific restrictions
- **Agent Delegation**: Complex operations delegated to specialist agents
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized and validated
- **Quality Gates**: Progressive validation at each workflow stage
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failures with actionable guidance

### Command Structure
```yaml
Frontmatter Fields:
  description: Brief command purpose
  args: <required> [optional] [--flag value]
  tools: Specific tools with restrictions (e.g., Bash(npm test:*))
  model: claude-opus-4-1-20250805 or claude-sonnet-4-20250514

- Comprehensive testing
- Performance validated
- Security reviewed

### Enterprise (Mission Critical)
- 95% quality gates
- Full compliance audits
- Complete documentation
- Extensive monitoring

## Command Development

### Creating New Commands

1. **Choose appropriate directory**:
   - `00-meta/` - Orchestration and coordination
   - `01-foundation/` - Core development commands
   - `03-agents/` - Agent-specific commands
   - `quality/` - Testing and validation
   - `workflows/` - Multi-step processes
   - `utils/` - Helper utilities
   - `automation/` - CI/CD and automation
   - `ops/` - Operations and deployment

2. **Use standard frontmatter**:
   ```yaml
   ---
   description: Clear, concise description
   args: <required> [optional] [--flag value]
   tools: Task, Read  # Minimal permissions
   model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514  # Or opus for complex orchestration
   ---
   ```

3. **Follow security principles**:
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use least privilege for tools
   - Delegate dangerous operations to agents
   - Include error handling

4. **Test thoroughly**:
   ```bash
   # Validate command structure
   ./scripts/verify-commands.sh

   # Test with sample inputs
   /your-command "test input"
   ```

## Integration with Agent Ecosystem

Commands seamlessly integrate with 22 specialized agents:
- **Foundation Tier**: Core development (API, review, test, debug)
- **Development Tier**: Language specialists (Python, TypeScript, frontend)
- **Specialist Tier**: Domain experts (cloud, database, DevOps)
- **Expert Tier**: Advanced capabilities (ML, security, research)

## Best Practices

1. **Start with `/workflow`** for complex multi-phase features
2. **Use `/agent`** for direct specialist invocation
3. **Run `/test`** and `/review`** before deployments
4. **Leverage `/performance`** for optimization
5. **Apply `/quick-fix`** for common issues

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found
- Ensure Claude Code is restarted after adding commands
- Check command file has `.md` extension
- Verify frontmatter is valid YAML

### Permission Errors
- Review `tools` declaration in frontmatter
- Use specific tool restrictions (e.g., `Bash(npm:*)`)
- Delegate privileged operations to agents

### Execution Failures
- Check argument format matches `args` pattern
- Verify required agents are installed
- Review error messages for guidance
