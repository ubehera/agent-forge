## Pattern Day Trader Rules (PDT)

### Key Rules
- **Definition**: 4+ day trades within 5 business days
- **Minimum Equity**: $25,000 required if flagged as PDT
- **Day Trade Definition**: Buy and sell (or sell and buy) same security same day
- **Consequences**: Trading restriction if rules violated

### Implementation Guidance
```python
class PDTChecker:
    """
    Pattern Day Trader rule enforcement
    Track day trades in rolling 5-business-day window
    """

    def __init__(self, account_value: float):
        self.account_value = account_value
        self.day_trades = []  # List of day trade dates

    def is_day_trade(self, symbol: str, buy_time: datetime, sell_time: datetime) -> bool:
        """Check if buy and sell constitute a day trade"""
        return buy_time.date() == sell_time.date()

    def add_day_trade(self, trade_date: date):
        """Record a day trade"""
        self.day_trades.append(trade_date)

        # Remove trades older than 5 business days
        cutoff_date = trade_date - timedelta(days=7)  # Approximate
        self.day_trades = [d for d in self.day_trades if d >= cutoff_date]

    def can_day_trade(self) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
        """Check if account can execute day trade"""

        # Count day trades in last 5 business days
        day_trade_count = len(self.day_trades)

        # If <3 day trades, allow
        if day_trade_count < 3:
            return True, f"OK ({day_trade_count}/3 day trades used)"

        # If 3 day trades already, check account value
        if day_trade_count == 3:
            if self.account_value >= 25000:
                return True, "PDT account (>$25K) - unlimited day trades"
            else:
                return False, "PDT limit reached - account <$25K"

        # If 4+ day trades and account >=$25K, allow
        if self.account_value >= 25000:
            return True, "PDT account (>$25K) - unlimited day trades"

        return False, "PDT restriction - account <$25K with 4+ day trades"
```

## Wash Sale Rules

### Key Rules
- **Definition**: Sell security at loss, repurchase "substantially identical" security within 30 days (before or after)
- **Consequence**: Loss is disallowed, added to cost basis of repurchased security
- **Window**: 30 days before sale + 30 days after sale = 61-day window
- **Substantially Identical**: Same stock, or call option on same stock

### Implementation Guidance
```python
class WashSaleTracker:
    """
    Wash sale rule tracking
    Monitor 61-day window (30 before + 30 after) for each loss sale
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.trades = []  # All trades

    def add_trade(self, symbol: str, date: datetime, quantity: int, price: float, realized_gain: float):
        """Record a trade"""
        self.trades.append({
            'symbol': symbol,
            'date': date,
            'quantity': quantity,
            'price': price,
            'realized_gain': realized_gain
        })

    def check_wash_sales(self, symbol: str, sale_date: datetime, loss_amount: float) -> List[Dict]:
        """
        Check for wash sales for a loss-generating sale
        Returns list of wash sale violations
        """

        wash_sales = []

        # Define 61-day window
        window_start = sale_date - timedelta(days=30)
        window_end = sale_date + timedelta(days=30)

        # Find all purchases of same symbol within window
        for trade in self.trades:
            if (trade['symbol'] == symbol and
                trade['quantity'] > 0 and  # Purchase
                window_start <= trade['date'] <= window_end and
                trade['date'] != sale_date):  # Not the sale itself

                wash_sales.append({
                    'sale_date': sale_date,
                    'sale_loss': loss_amount,
                    'repurchase_date': trade['date'],
                    'repurchase_price': trade['price'],
                    'repurchase_quantity': trade['quantity'],
                    'days_apart': abs((trade['date'] - sale_date).days),
                    'disallowed_loss': loss_amount,  # Simplified - actual calc more complex
                    'adjusted_basis': trade['price'] + (loss_amount / trade['quantity'])
                })

        return wash_sales
```
