## Multi-Agent Workflows

### Complete Strategy Development
```
User: "Develop a momentum trading strategy for tech stocks"

Workflow:
1. market-data-engineer: Set up NASDAQ-100 data pipeline
2. quantitative-analyst: Calculate momentum indicators (ROC, ADX, MACD)
3. trading-strategy-architect: Backtest with vectorbt, walk-forward validation
4. trading-risk-manager: Apply Kelly criterion position sizing
5. algorithmic-trading-engineer: Deploy to paper trading (Alpaca)
6. trading-compliance-officer: Validate PDT compliance

Result: Validated, risk-managed strategy ready for paper trading
```

### Fundamental + Technical Strategy
```
User: "Find undervalued stocks with strong momentum"

Workflow:
1. equity-research-analyst: Screen for low P/E, high ROE stocks
2. quantitative-analyst: Filter for positive momentum (RSI, MACD)
3. trading-strategy-architect: Backtest combined strategy
4. trading-risk-manager: Portfolio optimization across selected stocks
5. algorithmic-trading-engineer: Execute trades with TWAP algorithm

Result: Fundamental stock selection with technical entry timing
```

### ML-Enhanced Trading
```
User: "Use machine learning to predict price movements"

Workflow:
1. market-data-engineer: Fetch training data (5 years historical)
2. quantitative-analyst: Generate technical features (50+ indicators)
3. trading-ml-specialist: Train XGBoost with walk-forward validation
4. trading-strategy-architect: Integrate ML signals into backtest
5. trading-risk-manager: Validate risk metrics (Sharpe >1.5)
6. algorithmic-trading-engineer: Deploy if validated

Result: ML-powered strategy with realistic performance expectations
```

## Agent Coordination Patterns

### Data Flow
```
market-data-engineer → quantitative-analyst → trading-strategy-architect
                                            → equity-research-analyst
```

### Validation Chain
```
trading-strategy-architect → trading-risk-manager → algorithmic-trading-engineer
                                                  → trading-compliance-officer
```

### Advanced Workflows

## Technology Stack

### Data & Infrastructure
- **Databases**: TimescaleDB, QuestDB, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Message Queues**: Kafka, Redis Streams
- **Data Providers**: Alpaca, Polygon.io, IEX Cloud, Alpha Vantage

### Analysis & ML
- **Python Libraries**: NumPy, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Technical Analysis**: TA-Lib, pandas-ta
- **Options**: Black-Scholes, Greeks calculation
- **Backtesting**: vectorbt, backtrader, zipline

- **Portfolio Optimization**: cvxpy, scipy.optimize, PyPortfolioOpt
- **Risk Metrics**: VaR, CVaR, Sharpe, Sortino, max drawdown

## Quality Standards

### Data Quality
- Uptime: >99.95% during market hours
- Latency: <100ms from exchange to database
- Completeness: >99.99% (no missing bars)

### Strategy Quality
- Sharpe Ratio: >1.5 out-of-sample
- Max Drawdown: <20%
- Walk-Forward: >60% positive windows

### Execution Quality
- Order Success: >99.9%
- Slippage: <0.05% vs expected
- Fill Rate: >95% (limit orders)

### Compliance
- PDT Accuracy: 100%
- Wash Sale Detection: 100%
- Audit Trail: Complete for all trades

## Key Differentiators

1. **Production-Ready**: Complete code examples with error handling, logging, type hints
2. **Multi-Broker**: Abstraction layer supports Alpaca, E*TRADE, Fidelity
3. **Options Support**: Greeks, options chains, options strategies
4. **Risk-First**: Mandatory risk validation before any trade execution
5. **Compliance Built-In**: PDT rules, wash sales automated
6. **Realistic Backtesting**: Transaction costs, slippage, walk-forward analysis

## Common Pitfalls Avoided

- ✅ Walk-forward validation (not just in-sample optimization)
- ✅ Transaction costs included in all backtests
- ✅ No look-ahead bias in technical indicators
- ✅ Position sizing mandatory (no unlimited risk)
- ✅ Risk limits enforced before execution
- ✅ Regulatory compliance (PDT, wash sales) automated

## Getting Started

### Beginner: Paper Trading
```
1. Set up Alpaca paper trading account (free)
2. Use market-data-engineer to fetch historical data
3. Use quantitative-analyst to calculate indicators
4. Use trading-strategy-architect to backtest
5. Deploy to Alpaca paper trading
```

### Intermediate: Live Trading (Small Account)
```
1. Connect real broker (Alpaca, E*TRADE)
2. Start with small position sizes (<5% per trade)
3. Enable trading-compliance-officer for PDT monitoring
4. Use trading-risk-manager for position sizing
5. Monitor execution quality daily
```

### Advanced: Multiple Strategies
```
1. Develop 3-5 uncorrelated strategies
2. Use trading-risk-manager for portfolio optimization
3. Deploy with algorithmic-trading-engineer
4. Monitor with trading-ml-specialist for model decay
5. Monthly performance review
```

## Support & Maintenance

- **Agent Updates**: Quarterly reviews for broker API changes
- **Regulatory Updates**: Annual review of compliance rules
- **Technology Updates**: Python library updates (pandas, NumPy, vectorbt)
- **Broker Support**: Add new brokers as requested

## Next Steps

1. **Install agents**: `./scripts/install-agents.sh --user`
2. **Test routing**: Ask "Set up market data pipeline" → should invoke market-data-engineer
3. **Explore workflows**: Try the multi-agent workflows above
4. **Start building**: Begin with paper trading, validate strategies thoroughly
