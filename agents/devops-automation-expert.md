## CI/CD Pipeline Templates

### Multi-Stage Pipeline
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
name: Production Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x, 20.x]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - name: Install and Test
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm run test:unit
          npm run test:integration
      
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
      - name: SAST with Semgrep
        uses: returntocorp/semgrep-action@v1
  
  build:
    needs: [test, security-scan]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build and Push Docker Image
        run: |
          docker build -t app:${{ github.sha }} .
          docker push app:${{ github.sha }}
  
  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
        run: |
          kubectl set image deployment/app app=app:${{ github.sha }}
          kubectl rollout status deployment/app
```

### GitOps Configuration
```yaml
# ArgoCD Application
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: production-app
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/org/config-repo
    targetRevision: HEAD
    path: environments/production
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: production
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
    syncOptions:
    - CreateNamespace=true
```

## Infrastructure Automation

### Terraform Modules
```hcl
# Kubernetes cluster module
module "eks_cluster" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"
  version = "19.0.0"
  
  cluster_name    = var.cluster_name
  cluster_version = "1.28"
  
  vpc_id     = module.vpc.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = module.vpc.private_subnets
  
  eks_managed_node_groups = {
    main = {
      desired_capacity = 3
      max_capacity     = 10
      min_capacity     = 2
      
      instance_types = ["t3.medium"]
      
      k8s_labels = {
        Environment = "production"
        ManagedBy   = "terraform"
      }
    }
  }
  
  cluster_addons = {
    coredns    = { most_recent = true }
    kube-proxy = { most_recent = true }
    vpc-cni    = { most_recent = true }
    ebs-csi    = { most_recent = true }
  }
}
```

### Ansible Playbooks
```yaml
# Application deployment playbook
---
- name: Deploy Application
  hosts: app_servers
  become: yes
  vars:
    app_version: "{{ lookup('env', 'APP_VERSION') }}"
  
  tasks:
    - name: Pull latest Docker image
      docker_image:
        name: "app:{{ app_version }}"
        source: pull
    
    - name: Deploy application container
      docker_container:
        name: app
        image: "app:{{ app_version }}"
        state: started
        restart_policy: always
        ports:
          - "8080:8080"
        env:
          DATABASE_URL: "{{ vault_database_url }}"
    
    - name: Health check
      uri:
        url: http://localhost:8080/health
        status_code: 200
      register: result
      until: result.status == 200
      retries: 30
      delay: 10
```

## Monitoring & Observability

### Prometheus Configuration
```yaml
# Prometheus rules
groups:
  - name: application
    rules:
      - alert: HighErrorRate
        expr: rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) > 0.05
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: High error rate detected
          description: "Error rate is {{ $value | humanizePercentage }}"
      
      - alert: HighLatency
        expr: histogram_quantile(0.99, http_request_duration_seconds) > 1
        for: 10m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: High latency detected
```

### Grafana Dashboards
```json
{
  "dashboard": {
    "title": "Application Metrics",
    "panels": [
      {
        "title": "Request Rate",
        "targets": [
          {
            "expr": "rate(http_requests_total[5m])"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "title": "Error Rate",
        "targets": [
          {
            "expr": "rate(http_requests_total{status=~\"5..\"}[5m])"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
