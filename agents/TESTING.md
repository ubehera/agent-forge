# Agent Testing & Validation Checklist

This document provides comprehensive testing procedures for validating the ubehera agent collection after enhancements and updates.

## Pre-Testing Setup

### Installation Verification
```bash

cp agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Verify all agents are installed
ls ~/.claude/agents/ | grep -E "(api-platform|aws-cloud|data-pipeline|devops-automation|full-stack|machine-learning|performance-optimization|security-architect|system-design)"

# Count should be 9 agents
ls ~/.claude/agents/*.md | wc -l

- **Critical Issues**: Document any agents that fail multiple tests
- **Performance Impact**: Note any significant response time changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Agent Not Invoked**: Check description keywords, restart Claude Code
2. **Wrong Agent Selected**: Refine trigger keywords in description
3. **MCP Tools Not Working**: Verify MCP server configuration
4. **Performance Degradation**: Check tool restrictions and complexity

### Resolution Steps
1. **Review agent descriptions** for clarity
2. **Test with more specific keywords**
3. **Check Claude Code logs** for errors
4. **Verify MCP server status** if using MCP tools
