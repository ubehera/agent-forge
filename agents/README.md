## Installation & Validation
```bash
# Install or refresh all agents for the current user
./scripts/install-agents.sh --user

# Validate structure, frontmatter, and tool declarations
./scripts/verify-agents.sh

# Generate a quality snapshot (optional)
python3 scripts/quality-scorer.py --agents-dir agents --output quality-report.json
```
- Restart Claude Code after installation.
- Follow `agents/TESTING.md` to exercise automatic invocation and cross-agent workflows.

## Contribution Notes
- Place new agents in the appropriate tier directory (`agents/00-meta`, `agents/01-foundation`, ...).
- Keep `tools` lists minimal to match least-privilege guidance.
- Update this catalog, `../AGENTS.md`, and `configs/agent-metadata.json` whenever agents are added, renamed, or removed.
