- **System Design**: 8.2/10 (exceptional patterns)
- **DevOps Automation**: 7.2/10 (strong technical foundation)

## MCP Tool Compatibility

**Note**: MCP tool availability depends on your Claude Code configuration. Agents will use available MCP tools when present:

- **mcp__memory**: State management and knowledge persistence
- **mcp__fetch**: External API testing and validation
- **mcp__sequential-thinking**: Complex problem decomposition
- **mcp__ide**: Code execution and diagnostics (if configured)

Agents function fully without MCP tools but leverage them when available for enhanced capabilities.

## Installation & Usage

### For Current User:
```bash
cp agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/
```

### For Project Only:
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/agents
cp agents/*.md .claude/agents/
```

### Verify Installation:
```bash
ls ~/.claude/agents/ | grep -E "(api-platform|aws-cloud|system-design)"
```

**Important**: Restart Claude Code after installing or modifying agents.

## Development Philosophy

This collection prioritizes:
1. **Production-ready patterns** over academic examples
2. **Practical implementation** over theoretical knowledge
3. **Security by default** across all domains
4. **Performance awareness** in all recommendations
5. **DevOps integration** throughout the development lifecycle

## Contributing
